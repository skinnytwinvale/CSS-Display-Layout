# CSS-Display-Layout

## Display

display is CSS's most important property for controlling layout. Every element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default for most elements is usually block or inline. A block element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline element.

These are four of the most commonly-used values for display:

- none - An element with a display property of none won't show up on the page.
- block - A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it
can; that is, by default it takes up all available horizontal space. Common block-level elements are div, p, and form. New in HTML5 are header, footer, section, and more.
- inline - An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. span is the standard inline element, but there are others too, like strong, b, and em. The a element is often the most common inline element, since they are used for links. 
- inline-block - this value is sort of a hybrid of block and inline. To see how this works, let's look at an example.
